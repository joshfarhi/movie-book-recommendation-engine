# movie-book-recommendation-engine
# Overview
This project is designed to build a Recommendation Engine for suggesting personalized movies or books based on user preferences. 
The engine supports two recommendation methods:

# Collaborative Filtering
Recommends items based on user ratings and interactions.
# Content-Based Filtering
Recommends items based on metadata such as genres, authors, and descriptions.

The system is optimized to handle large datasets using Django ORM with query optimizations and caching for faster retrieval. Additionally, the project includes data visualization to showcase trends and user preferences.

# Features
# Personalized Recommendations
Recommends movies/books based on user preferences.
# Collaborative Filtering
Suggests items based on user-to-user or item-to-item similarity.
# Content-Based Filtering
Suggests items based on item metadata (genres, authors, etc.).
# Caching
Utilizes Redis for faster recommendation retrieval.
# Query Optimization
Efficient data retrieval with Django ORM techniques (select_related, prefetch_related).
# Data Visualization
Displays recommendation trends and user preference insights using graphs.
# Tech Stack
#Backend
Django, Django ORM
# Database
PostgreSQL or MySQL
# Caching
Redis
# Recommendation Engine
Python, scikit-learn, surprise (for collaborative filtering)
# Visualization
matplotlib, plotly, django-plotly-dash
# Front-end
Django templates (HTML, CSS)

# Datasets
# Movies Datasets
You can use the following datasets to populate movie information:

The Movie Database (TMDb)
IMDb Datasets, 
MovieLens Datasets, 
Books Datasets, 

For books, you can use:

Goodreads API, 
Project Gutenberg, 
Google Books API, 
After downloading or accessing the API, make sure to structure the data according to the models in the project.

# Process for Completing the Project
# 1. Define Models
Create the database models for users, items (movies/books), ratings, and genres in models.py.
# 2. Load and Optimize Data
Fetch datasets for movies and books (using APIs like TMDb or Goodreads).
Use Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related to optimize queries when retrieving data.
# 3. Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
Implement collaborative filtering in recommendation_engine.py using libraries like scikit-learn or surprise.
Use user-item rating matrix to compute similarities and recommend items.
# 4. Content-Based Filtering Algorithm
Use metadata such as genre, author, and description to recommend items similar to what the user has interacted with.
Store this logic in recommendation_engine.py.
# 5. Caching
Use Redis for caching frequently queried recommendations.
Implement caching in views.py using Django’s cache framework.
# 6. Visualize Data
Use matplotlib or plotly to create graphs for displaying trends and preferences.
Incorporate data visualizations in Django templates (templates/) using a separate view function in views.py.
# 7. Front-End Integration
Use Django templates to render recommendations and graphs.
Allow users to log in, view personalized recommendations, and visualize their rating history.
# 8. Testing
Write unit tests for models, views, and recommendation algorithms to ensure the system works as expected.
Run tests with pytest or Django’s built-in test framework.
# Future Improvements
# Hybrid Recommendation System
Combine collaborative filtering with content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
# Scalability
Implement more advanced recommendation algorithms like matrix factorization or deep learning models.
Performance Tuning: Scale caching strategies and database optimizations to support larger datasets.
